This is a simulation tool I wrote during work in my PhD thesis.

LabLOVE is an open source software platform for evolutionary multi-agent simulations. It allows for the definition of scenarios where populations of autonomous agents evolve through processes inspired in Darwinian evolution.

LabLOVE is a scientific research tool with several fields of application, including the generation of artificial intelligence through evolution and biological and social simulations.

## JFastEMD

This is a pure Java implementation of the Fast Earth Mover's Algorithm by Ofir Pele and Michael Werman. In fact, it's a partial port of the C++ implementation that can be found here:
