This is an ongoing project that I startes with my friend [Chih-Chun Chen](http://abmcet.net/). It is now also part of my research activity in the context of the [Algopol project](http://algopol.fr/).

GraphBrain is a knowledge hyper-graph with a natural language processing interface. Another way to put it is that it is a complex database of facts that can understand human language, be it from web sources or direct user commands. It can remember and derive new relationships between things. It wants to be a new type of Artificial Intelligence. I will write more about this as the project develops.
