I am a Computer Scientist and Hacker, with a background and strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Complex Systems. I also love to build cool stuff. I use this site as a repository of information about my projects, publications, and anything else I believe worthy of sharing with the world.

I currently work as a researcher for the [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/), the French national research center, more specifically the [CAMS lab](http://cams.ehess.fr/). I currently live in Berlin, where I am graciously hosted by the [Marc Bloch Centre](http://www.cmb.hu-berlin.de/en/).

## Short Bio

I have been fascinated by computers from a young age and taught myself to program while in basic school. I have a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Coimbra, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. Before, I worked as a software engineer. I developed a software module as part of a larger project for NASA. Later I worked for a mobile search startup company in Cambridge, UK. During my PhD work, I developed a new type of agent controller, called the gridbrain, that allows for embedded evolution in the context of multi-agent simulations. Shortly after finishing my PhD, I moved to Paris, to work as a researcher for the CNRS. There I have been working in an inter-disciplinary environment, exploring ideas like artificial social scientists, digital humanities and knowledge hyper-graphs.
