I am a Computer Scientist and Hacker, with a background and strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Complex Systems. I also love to build cool stuff. I use this site as a repository of information about my projects, publications, and anything else I believe worthy of sharing with the world.

I currently work as a researcher for the CNRS, the French national research center, more specifically the CAMS lab. I currently live in Berlin, where I am graciously hosted by the Marc Bloch Center.

## Current Projects

### GraphBrain

GraphBrain is a personalised, intelligent, user-friendly knowledge engine. It integrates both traditional (Google-style) search and question answering systems (e.g. Wolfram alpha, IBM's Watson), but goes beyond both. This ambitious project is a major step forward in terms of how people will interact with computers.

Traditional search is based on names and terms, and relies on users already knowing the label for the thing they are searching for. This also means users miss out on highly relevant content that is closely related to a targeted search if they do not explicitly query for it. GraphBrain provides an alternative to this traditional paradigm by allowing users to search for and browse content based on semantic relationships. Users simply type in their query (as they would for a normal search), but in addition to the directly targeted results, content that is closely related semantically is also made available. This is similar to getting dynamically rendered Wikipedia articles about each of the candidates for the search term.

In addition to search terms, the interface also handles queries and commands in natural language, e.g. “Show me all the films Nicole Kidman has starred in since 2000.”, “Which is the most expensive restaurant in London?”, “Buy this book on amazon.”, "Which books written by German authors have I read?".

What makes GraphBrain a unique product offering however is the fact that it can mange both public and personal information. Users are free to add facts that are only relevant to them (e.g. "I met John Smith at the company meeting in Paris."). It can distinguish between knowledge that is only relevant (and should only be displayed) to a specific user or group and knowledge that is relevant to everybody. From the same interface, users can have access to and manage both spheres of knowledge.

GraphBrain is fully integrated with the web, being able to store and understand knowledge about real-world entities (e.g. the city of Paris) and Internet entities represented by URLs.

### Syntehtic

Synthetic is a scientific experimentation tool aimed at studying the genesis and dynamics of complex networks using multi-agent simulations and evolutionary computation.

Following a standard view in Complexity Science, networks are seen as the emergent outcome of the local, low-level interactions of autonomous agents. The idea of using a multi-agent simulation to model a complex network is not new, but it presents challenges to the human modeler. As simplifying assumptions are removed, or the target network becomes more complex, the discovery of the corresponding low-level mechanism becomes harder. Synthetic aims at aiding and, to a degree, automating this discovery process with evolutionary search.

## Short Bio

I have been fascinated by computers from a young age and taught myself to program while in basic school. I have a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Coimbra, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. Before, I worked as a software engineer. I developed a software module as part of a larger project for NASA. Later I worked for a mobile search startup company in Cambridge, UK. During my PhD work, I developed a new type of agent controller, called the gridbrain, that allows for embedded evolution in the context of multi-agent simulations. Shortly after finishing my PhD, I moved to Paris, to work as a researcher for the CNRS. There I have been working in an inter-disciplinary environment, exploring ideas like artificial social scientists, digital humanities and knowledge hyper-graphs.
