I am a Computer Scientist and Hacker, with a background and strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Complex Systems. I also love to build cool stuff. I use this site as a repository of information about my projects, publications, and anything else I believe worthy of sharing with the world.

## Short Bio

I was born in Coimbra, Portugal in 1976 and took both my BSc and PhD degrees in Computer Science at the University of Coimbra. I developed a software module as part of a larger project for NASA. Later I worked for a mobile search startup company in Cambridge, UK. During my PhD work, I developed a new type of agent controller, called the gridbrain, that allows for embedded evolution in the context of multi-agent simulations. Shortly after finishing my PhD, I moved to Paris, where I have been holding positions as a Postdoctoral Researcher. One of the focuses of my current work discovery of the low level mechanisms that underlie the genesis and topology of Complex Networks.
