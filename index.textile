h2. About

My name is Telmo Menezes and I am a Computer Scientist and Hacker, with a background and strong interest in Complex Systems and Computational Intelligence. I also love to build cool stuff. I use this site as a repository of information about my projects, publications, and anything else I believe worthy of sharing with the world.
