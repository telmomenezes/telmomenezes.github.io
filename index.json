Recent empirical studies generally suggest that filter bubbles may principally be observed in the case of explicit recommendation (based on user-declared preferences) rather than implicit recommendation (based on user activity). We focus on YouTube which has become a major online content provider but where confinement has until now been little-studied in a systematic manner. Starting from a diverse number of seed videos, we first describe the properties of the sets of suggested videos in order to design a sound exploration protocol able to capture latent recommendation graphs recursively induced by these suggestions. These graphs form the background of potential user navigations along non-personalized recommendations. From there, be it in topological, topical or temporal terms, we show that the landscape of what we call mean-field YouTube recommendations is often prone to confinement dynamics. Moreover, the most confined recommendation graphs i.e., potential bubbles, seem to be organized around sets of videos that garner the highest audience and thus plausibly viewing time.","tags":["Computational Social Science","Recommendation Algorithms","Filter Bubbles"],"title":"Tubes \u0026 Bubbles -- Topological confinement of YouTube recommendations","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575936000,"objectID":"caae860642a4c9fb736c2b599bca04cf","permalink":"/talk/automatic-discovery-of-families-of-network-generative-processes/","publishdate":"2019-11-24T20:06:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/automatic-discovery-of-families-of-network-generative-processes/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Automatic Discovery of Families of Network Generative Processes","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1574629673,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574629673,"objectID":"be7542fd6f29599b3b2e337c9eb27d89","permalink":"/project/synthetic/","publishdate":"2019-11-24T22:07:53+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/synthetic/","section":"project","summary":"A machine learning tool that can be used to discover plausible generators for complex networks.

We attempt to advance the state of the art by introducing a model and algorithmic framework to transform text into recursively structured data.

We show that a recursive ordered hypergraph is a sufficiently generic structure to represent significant number of fundamental natural language constructs, with advantages over conventional approaches such as semantic graphs. We present a pipeline of transformations from the output of conventional NLP algorithms to such hypergraphs, which we denote as semantic hypergraphs. The features of these transformations include the creation of new concepts from existing ones, the organisation of statements into regular structures of predicates followed by an arbitrary number of entities and the ability to represent statements about other statements. We demonstrate knowledge inference from the hypergraph, identifying claims and expressions of conflicts, along with their participating actors and topics. We show how this enables the actor-centric summarization of conflicts, comparison of topics of claims between actors and networks of conflicts between actors in the context of a given topic. On the whole, we propose a hypergraphic knowledge representation model that can be used to provide effective overviews of a large corpus of text in natural language.

I am really happy with the final result and the fact that it is open access.\nExplaining network growth is a challenge that appears in a surprising number of disciplines. For example, neuroscientists are interested in understanding how brains develop, and sociologists in how social networks acquire a certain topology.\nFinding plausible explanations is not trivial. Real networks tend to be large and complex. Reverse-engineering the growth process from a snapshot of a network is a problem that easily defeats human intuition.\nSo we developed a method to look for such explanations automatically. We employ evolutionary computation, a machine learning technique inspired by natural selection. Network growth processes (a.k.a. network generators) are represented by simple computer programs. In other words, using only the snapshot of a given network, our method automatically discovers simple laws plausibly governing its evolution. For instance, from an empirical political blog network (see below) we find an equation as simple as exp(4−2d).\nThis suggests that a generative process giving exponential priority to closer nodes is able to successfully reconstruct many key features of the original network.\nThe evolutionary process evaluates the quality of generators by creating synthetic networks according to the growth process they define and then comparing these synthetic networks to the target, real network. The comparison is done using a set of well-known metrics that target both macro and micro-level features of the networks.\nThe best way to understand the method is, of course, to read the paper .\nWe are also releasing an open-source software tool called Synthetic that any researcher can apply to their own networks. If you are interested, don’t hesitate to contact us. We would love to hear from any attempts (successful or not) at using Synthetic outside of our lab.\nTo illustrate what can be achieved, I leave you with seven generators we discovered. They cover very different types of networks, including a simple brain, protein interactions and social networks. The following table describes the variables used in the expressions:\n  Generator variables   The expressions that define the generators use these variables to assign weights to the pairs of unconnected nodes in the network. The higher the weight, the more likely it is that the generator will establish a connection between the nodes.\nA simple example: consider a \u0026ldquo;rich get richer\u0026rdquo; phenomena. The more incoming connection a node has, the more likely it is to receive more connections. Such a generator could be defined as:\n$$w(i,j)=k(j)$$\nThe following examples are roughly ordered by increasing complexity of the generator.\nPolitical Blogs Citation network of political blogs during the 2004 American presidential elections\n  Political bloggers   $$w(i, j) = exp(4 – 2d)$$\nThe political blogs generator takes a single variable: $d$. Unlike with $d_D$, the case where d=1 can happen, as this distance may be caused by an arc with the opposite direction of the one being proposed. This generator behaviour can be simply described, as shown in the following figure:\n  Political bloggers   Reciprocity is strongly encouraged, given the high weight given to arcs with $d=1$.\nIn fact, this situation necessarily corresponds to a reciprocal arc (linking to a blog that linked to you), because arcs that already exist are not allowed in the sample. Then, weight decreases as undirected distance increases, but never to 0. This distribution of weights according to undirected distances is sufficient to generate the two communities in the network — links between blogs that have a low undirected distance are more probable, but links to more distant blogs are also possible. This leads to the low density of links between the two communities. Surprisingly, it is possible to propose a plausible generator that leads to the two communities without resorting to a priori diversity (e.g Democrats vs. Republicans), that could be expressed with sequential identifiers or the affinity function. It can be speculated that this matches the way in which political ideology propagates in society.\nWord Adjacencies Network of word adjacencies in the novel David Copperfield by Charles Dickens\n  Photo by Antonio Litterio licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.   $$w(i, j) = k(i) – d$$\nThis network represents the adjacencies of common adjectives and nouns in the novel \u0026ldquo;David Copperfield\u0026rdquo; by Charles Dickens.\nThe generator configures a simple combination of preferential attachment with a preference for connecting to close vertices. An increase in the degree of a node also increases its reach, as the distance term can be higher with making the weight negative, and thus null.\nFacebook Neighbourhood of a single Facebook user\n$$w(i, j) = \\psi(3, i \\cdot k(i), k(i))$$\nThe facebook generator combines preferential attachment with affinity in a simple fashion. The constant value for the number of groups suggests pre-existing social circles.\n affinity: $i \\cdot k(i)$ no affinity: $k(i)$  The role of the factor $i$ in case of affinity appears to be two-fold: increase the propensity for connections inside pre-existing social circles (for the most cases $i \u0026gt; 1$) and capture an external preference for certain connections within such groups over others. This matches the intuition that popularity in the real world is expressed in the facebook social graph.\nConnections between groups follow a pure preferential attachment regime, matching the intuition that more popular individuals are more likely to act as bridges between communities.\nC. Elegans Brain of a C. Elegans roundworm\n  Crawling C. elegans (CC BY-SA 3.0 Bob Goldstein http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Goldstein/movies.html)   $$w(i, j) = log(d_D)d_D – 7 – min(j + 0.52, 0.77)$$\nThe C.elegans generator uses two variables: $d_D$ and $j$. Given the term where $j$ appears, $min(j + 0.52, 0.77)$, a distinction is only made between $j = 0$ and $j \u0026gt; 0$. For the first case, the term takes the value $0.52$, for the second the value $0.77$. The first term uses the $d_D$ variable, which takes integer values in ${0, \u0026hellip;, 5}$. Only values equal to or greater than $2$ are relevant, given that $d_D = 0$ configures a self-link, while $d_D = 1$ indicates an already existing arc. Both these situations are prohibited in the configuration we use.\nAs negative values are considered null weights, we can reduce the generator to $3$ possible situations, shown in the following table:\n  Weights table for C.elegans generator.   Here we can see that the rule is indeed very simple: the generator promotes the creation of A→B arcs where an A→C→B arc already exists ($d_D = 2$). For the special case of an arc where the target has the sequential identifier $0$, $d_D = 3$ is also allowed, albeit with a much lower probability. For $d_D = 2$, connection to this special node are also slightly preferred.\nSequential identifiers are abstractions meant to capture some a priori heterogeneity in the vertex set, so the meaning of the special node 0 can only be speculated on. It might represent a certain spatial constraint for a neuron or a different behaviour of the neuron through some mechanism. Such interpretations are beyond the scope of the work and better left to researchers with the adequate domain knowledge.\nProteins A network of protein interactions in Homo Sapiens\n  Copyright by BASF. Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)   $$w(i,j)=⎧⎨⎩log(i),if k(j)={0,if k(i) \u0026lt; 4k(i),otherwise−1,otherwise$$\nThe protein interactions generator only assigns a non-null weight in two cases: if the target is not yet connected and the origin has a low degree ($k(i) \u0026lt; 4$), or if the degree of the origin and target are the same. Non-null weights are always $log(i)$, indicating an a priori logarithmically distributed propensity for interaction.\nThis generative process seems to indicate a strong preference for assortativity on degree, establishing edges between proteins that interact with a similar number of other proteins.\nSoftware Collaborations Collaboration network of authors from the CPAN Perl module repository\n  Photo by Marko Puusaar ( licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported)   $$w(i,j)=\\psi(k\u0026rsquo;(i)d,k\u0026rsquo;(j),0.7k(j))⋅min(k(j),9)$$\nThe software collaborations network represents software authors from the CPAN Perl language repository. An arc means then an author uses a software module from another author.\nHere we can see that the affinity operator is used. The first parameter of the operator represents the number of groups that the vertex set is divided into, so the higher this value, the less likely affinity between to arbitrary vertices becomes. The number of groups is rounded to the closest integer.\nAs the number of groups is determined by k′(i)d, an increase in the out-degree of the origin makes affinity less likely and an increase in undirected distance makes it more likely. The expression can be divided into two branches:\n affinity: $k\u0026rsquo;(j)⋅min(k(j),9)$ no affinity: $0.7k(j)⋅min(k(j),9)$  Both branches represent a form of preferential attachment. The first one uses a combination of the in- and out-degree of the target, while the second only considers the in-degree.\nA plausible interpretation is that the generator proposes two modes of discovery: by proximity in the network or by problem domain affinity. Affinity is more likely when the origin is still an outsider to the environment (low number of dependencies on other authors’ work) or when the topological distance is high — maybe an existing author expanding to a new problem domain. When module discovery is by proximity, the only thing that is taken into account is the number of authors that already depend on the work of the target — its popularity for a certain problem domain. When it is by affinity, the number of authors that it depends on also factors in. This could represent a measure of integrative power — how much the work of a certain author encapsulates existing solutions in a higher abstraction, providing a more useful entry point for a newcomer to its domain.\nPower Grid Power grid of the Western States of the USA\n  Photo by Guy Erwood and licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons Licence.   $$w(i,j)=\\psi(dd \\ cdot {i – 1, if k(j)=0k(i), otherwise, 1, 0)$$\nThe power grid generator also uses the affinity generator, but in a more binary fashion: the weight is always 1 if there is affinity and null if there is not. All the complexity of the generator is captured by the decision on the number of affinity groups. The following things can be noted about the expression that determines the number of groups:\n Overall, the probability of affinity decreases exponentially with distance. The node with the sequential identifier 1 overrides the previous rule if the target has no connections, by making the exponent null. This configures a central hub for newcomers to connect to. An origin with no connections overrides the previous rule if the target is already connected, also by making the exponent null.  This configures a branching growth behaviour, where new vertices either connect to a central hub or some already connected vertex, but connections between already connected or distant vertices are discouraged. The tree-like structure that originates from this matches our intuitions about the growth of a power grid. The affinity operator, by implicitly using sequence identifiers, might abstract at a high level the underlying spatial constraints.\n","date":1409875200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409932578,"objectID":"2e6de11d4e4912c1dda1e4133fdaf3ca","permalink":"/post/using-evolutionary-computation-to-explain-network-growth/","publishdate":"2014-09-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/using-evolutionary-computation-to-explain-network-growth/","section":"post","summary":"Explaining network growth is a challenge that appears in a surprising number of disciplines.

Models explaining their morphology and growth processes permit a wide range of phenomena to be more systematically analysed and understood.

We have developed an approach to automatically detect realistic decentralised network growth models from empirical data, employing a machine learning technique inspired by natural selection and defining a unified formalism to describe such models as computer programs. As the proposed method is completely general and does not assume any pre-existing models, it can be applied “out of the box” to any given network. To validate our approach empirically, we systematically rediscover pre-defined growth laws underlying several canonical network generation models and credible laws for diverse real-world networks. We were able to find programs that are simple enough to lead to an actual understanding of the mechanisms proposed, namely for a simple brain and a social network.","tags":["Computational Social Science","Network Science","Complex Systems","Generative Models","Evolutionary Computation"],"title":"Symbolic regression of generative network models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Telmo Menezes","Camille Roth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"14e79f1edf4a2347545b89715a6726ab","permalink":"/publication/menezes-2013-automatic/","publishdate":"2020-01-18T18:15:15.915473Z","relpermalink":"/publication/menezes-2013-automatic/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Automatic discovery of agent based models: An application to social anthropology","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Advances in fields such as Complexity Science and Artificial Life enable a modern direction in Computational Intelligence research.

Instead of building isolated artificial intelligence systems from the top-down, this approach attempts to design systems where a population of agents and the environment interact and adaptation processes take place.\nWe created a novel artificial brain model, called gridbrain, as well as an evolutionary environment embedded in a simulation. The gridbrain model defines agent brains as heterogeneous networks of computational building blocks.","tags":[],"title":"Evolutionary Multi-Agent Simulations","type":"post"},{"authors":["Telmo
